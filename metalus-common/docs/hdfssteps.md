# HDFSSteps
This step object provides a way to read from and write to HDFS. There are several step functions provided:

## Write to Path
This function will write a given DataFrame to the provided path. Full parameter descriptions are listed below:

* **dataFrame** - A dataFrame to be written to HDFS.
* **path** - A HDFS path to write to.
* **options** - Optional DataFrameWriterOptions object to configure the DataFrameWriter

## Read From Path
This function will read a file from the provided path into a DataFrame. Full parameter descriptions are listed below:

* **path** - A HDFS file path to read.
* **options** - Optional DataFrameReaderOptions object to configure the DataFrameReader

## Read From Paths
This function will read from each of the provided paths into a DataFrame. Full parameter descriptions are listed below:

* **paths** - A list of HDFS file paths to read.
* **options** - Optional DataFrameReaderOptions object to configure the DataFrameReader

## Create FileManager
This function will create a FileManager implementation that is useful for interacting with the underlying HDFS file 
system. This step requires no parameters and only interacts with the HDFS file system configured for this Spark instance.
