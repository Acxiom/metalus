* **streamName** - The Kinesis stream where data will be pulled
* **endPointURL** - The Kinesis URL where to connect the app.
* **regionName** - A valid AWS region
* **awsAccessKey** - The AWS access key used to connect
* **awsAccessSecret** - The AWS access secret used to connect

*Optional Parameters:*
* **consumerStreams** - [number] The number of streams to create. Defaults to the number of shards defined for the stream.
* **duration-type** - [minutes | **seconds**] Corresponds to the *duration* parameter.
