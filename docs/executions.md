# Executions
An execution is a body of work within a Metalus [application](applications.md). An execution defines which 
[pipelines](pipelines.md) are executed and the proper context.

![Execution Summary](images/Execution_Overview.png)

A single execution may run one or more pipelines in the order they are listed. As each pipeline completes, the status is
evaluated and a determination is made as to whether the next pipeline should be run. 

In addition to executing pipelines, an execution may be dependent on zero, one or more other executions. Executions may
run in parallel or be dependent on other executions. When a dependency exists, the execution will wait until all _parent_ 
executions complete with a favorable status before executing.

![Pipeline Execution Plan Example](images/Execution_Plan_Example.png "Pipeline Execution Dependencies")

When one execution has a dependency on one or more executions, the *globals* and *parameters* objects will be taken from the final 
[PipelineContext](pipeline-context.md) and injected into the globals object of the child executions _PipelineContext_. Values
may be accessed using the following mapping syntax:

Access the primary return of a step:
```json
!<executionId>.pipelineParameters.<pipelineId>.<stepId>.primaryReturn
```

Access the secondary return of a step:
```json
!<executionId>.pipelineParameters.<pipelineId>.<stepId>.namedReturn
```

Access the secondary return named value of a step:
```json
!<executionId>.pipelineParameters.<pipelineId>.<stepId>.namedReturn.<valueName>
```

Access a global:
```json
!<executionId>.globals.<globalName>
```

In the event that the result of an execution plan results in an exception or one of the pipelines being paused or errored,
then downstream executions will not run.

## Global Links
Global Links can be created to provide a shortened name that points to an object from a different pipeline or execution to
prevent the pipeline designer from having to type in the long name in multiple places in their application.  These abbreviated
names are stored in the _pipelineContext.globals_ under the name "GlobalLinks".  It contains key/value pairs where the key is
the shortened name and the value is the fully qualified parameter name (with executionIds, pipelineIds, etc... as stated above).
These are accessed as typical globals in the step values using the _!shortenedName_ syntax.

```json
"globals": {
  "GlobalLinks": {
    "myPrimaryReturn": "!<executionId>.pipelineParameters.<pipelineId>.<stepId>.primaryReturn",
    "mySecondaryReturn": "!<executionId>.pipelineParameters.<pipelineId>.<stepId>.namedReturn.<valueName>"
  }
}
```
To access the value of myPrimaryReturn in a future step, the user would use _!myPrimaryReturn_ and would get the value returned
from the parameter in the value.
 
_**Note:**_ in the case of global name collision, the latest value (child over parent) for a shortened name will be used.
