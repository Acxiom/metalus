# Http Rest Client
This object provides a simple client for communicating with restful services. The client requires a url and optional 
_Authorization_ class.

## Authorization
The _Authorization_ trait provides a single function named _authorize_ that is provided a URL Connection.

Any parameters required to instantiate the _Authorization_ instance need to be prefixed with _authorization._ so
they are identified and passed in. To use basic authorization, consider this class signature: 

```scala
class BasicAuthorization(username: String, password: String) extends Authorization
```
would need these command line parameters:
```
--authorization.class com.acxiom.pipeline.api.BasicAuthorization --authorization.username myuser --authorization.password mypasswd
```
